## Executive Summary

1. Problem statement
   - The objective of this project is to help high school seniors in California make more informed decisions about their majors by identifying which majors are most correlated with specific SAT scores.
                                                                                                                                                  
2. Description of data

    - **Target**: Classification
        1) To predict or identify the college major that high school students are likely to choose based on their SAT scores.
        2) To determine whether California high schools are hitting the Benchmark standards on the SAT.
        
3. Primary findings/conclusions/recommendations
    - Based on my findings some of the top majors include Math/Stats,Physical science, Social Science and Computer/Information sciences which can help high school seniors make informed decisions on what majors to choose. 
  
5. Next steps
    - This project could futher explore resources for CA high schools who arent meeting the SAT standards.
         1) Better resources for improved scores.
         2) Best educational practices for High school students and the community.
